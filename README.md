# Exam Proficiency Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzes data from the New York City Department of Education (NYC DOE) schools and districts. It provides insights into the academic performance and demographic composition of students across various schools and districts. Specifically, the project examines:

- The percentage of students in each school and district who achieved proficient scores on their year-end exams.
- The racial demographics of students, highlighting the percentage of students from different racial backgrounds for each school and district.
